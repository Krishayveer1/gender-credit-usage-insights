# gender-credit-usage-insights
This repository contains an R-based analysis of gender differences in credit card behavior using the Credit dataset from the ISLR package. Through exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, and regression models, we examine whether men and women differ in (1) credit rating, (2) credit limit, and (3) credit utilization. Our goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and assess if demographic factors like income or age outweigh gender in predicting financial behavior. All code, visualizations, and results are presented in a reproducible R Markdown workflow.
